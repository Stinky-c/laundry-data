    # Overview
    Apply these conditions regardless of the chosen database

    0. If any schema changes are made that do not follow the any conditions.
      Document the changes in a comment at the end of the script.
    1. Foreign keys are defined on the table creation, and not in row. They are only created at the end
      of the table using the FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES syntax.
    2. If any dialect exclusive features are included replicate them in the best way for the database
      and add a comment documenting the removal.
    3. If a column uses data type VARCHAR with a set length, add a constraint to ensure maintained length.
    4. If a function does not exist, find an alternative and document it.
    5. Ignore any comments outside of this note on the project.


    # Postgres
    Postgres 18 + timescale Conversion Standards. Apply these conditions when converting to postgres.

    1. Create 'LaundryLog' as a Timescale Hypertable using a with statement. The following arguments apply.
      a. 'tsdb.partition_column' is 'timestamp'
      b. 'tsdb.chunk_interval' is '1 day'


    # SQL Server
    Sql Server 2022 Conversion standards. Apply these conditions when converting to sql server.

     1. SQL Server does not support enums, instead use a text column with check constraints.
     2. SQL Server 2022 does not have a JSON column type, instead use a text field. It does not
      need to be large.
     3. SQL Server should not use datetime and timestamp columns, instead use the datetimeoffest type.


    
    # Sqlite
    SQLITE Conversion standards. Apply these conditions when converting to sqlite.

    1. Primary keys, the columns named "id", are always going to have the integer data type with
      primary key and autoincrement conditions. This does not include columns with "id" in the name.
    2. Any column that is of type UUID should be converted to TEXT.
    3. Any column that is of type JSON should be converted to TEXT. Do not include any checks for valid JSON
    4. Any column that is of type TIMESTAMPTZ and other time columns should be converted to TEXT.
    5. If any integer data type is missing, use INTEGER.
